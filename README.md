# The Problem

Training neural networks is fragile. A single NaN gradient, an OOM spike, or an exploding loss at hour 47 of a 48-hour run can destroy days of compute. Engineers waste enormous time adding manual checkpointing, writing recovery scripts, and babysitting long runs.

**ARC eliminates this entirely.** It wraps your training loop with an autonomous controller that:

1. **Monitors** - Tracks multi-signal telemetry (loss trajectory, gradient norms, weight health, optimizer state integrity)
2. **Predicts** - Uses signal-based classifiers to detect failures before they become irreversible
3. **Recovers** - Automatically rolls back to the last healthy checkpoint and applies corrective measures

You keep training. ARC keeps it alive.

# Quick Start

## Installation

```bash
pip install arc-training
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-kaushik2209/ARC.git
cd ARC
pip install -e .
```

---

## 3-Line Integration

```python
from arc import Arc

controller = Arc(model, optimizer)

for batch in dataloader:
    loss = model(batch)
    action = controller.step(loss)

    if not action.rolled_back:
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

ARC automatically handles:

- NaN detection
- Gradient explosion recovery
- Checkpoint management
- Learning rate correction
- Automatic rollback recovery

# Collaboration Guidelines

We welcome open-source contributions, architecture improvements, benchmarking extensions, research discussions and documentation enhancements.

---

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-kaushik2209/ARC.git
cd ARC
```

---

### 2. Open or Discuss an Issue First

Before starting implementation work, contributors are expected to:

- Open a new issue describing the proposed feature, improvement or bug fix
- Participate in issue discussions if clarification is required
- Wait for the issue to be assigned before beginning work

Pull requests raised without prior discussion or assignment may be closed if the contribution does not align with the current roadmap, architecture direction or active development priorities.

This process helps avoid duplicated work and keeps contributions coordinated across the project.

---

### 3. Create a Development Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use clear and descriptive branch names.

Examples:

```text
feature/failure-prediction-upgrade
fix/checkpoint-memory-leak
docs/installation-guide-update
```

---

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install all required dependencies before starting development to ensure local testing consistency.

---

### 5. Make Your Changes

Please keep contributions:

- Modular
- Well documented
- Consistent with the existing architecture
- Focused on a single feature or fix

For larger changes, keep commits logically separated wherever possible.

---

### 6. Commit Clearly

```bash
git commit -m "Add: short feature description"
```

Prefer concise and meaningful commit messages.

Examples:

```text
Add: gradient anomaly recovery module
Fix: checkpoint rollback edge case
Docs: improve installation instructions
```

---

### 7. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest repository changes before opening a pull request.

---

### 8. Open a Pull Request

Please include:

- A clear explanation of the contribution
- Motivation behind the change
- Relevant benchmarks, logs or screenshots if applicable
- References to the related issue

PRs should remain focused and avoid unrelated modifications.

---

## Pull Request Standards

To maintain repository quality:

- Keep PRs focused and minimal
- Avoid unrelated refactors
- Ensure code executes correctly before submission
- Add comments and docstrings where appropriate
- Maintain compatibility with the existing architecture
- Discuss major architectural changes before implementation

Submissions that significantly change project direction without prior discussion may be deferred or closed.

---

## Issue Reporting

When opening an issue, include:

- Clear problem description
- Expected behaviour
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant logs or screenshots
- Environment details if applicable

Bug reports with reproducible examples are highly appreciated.

---

## Development Principles

ARC prioritizes:

- Reliability over complexity
- Measured experimental validation
- Transparent benchmarking
- Modular system design
- Honest reporting of limitations

Contributions aligned with these principles are strongly encouraged.
