"""Regression test for ARC issue #8 — checkpoint pickle RCE.

Two layers of tests:

1. Low-level PyTorch sanity (test_malicious_pickle_blocked_by_weights_only,
   test_safe_checkpoint_loads_with_weights_only): verify the upstream
   ``torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`` flag itself rejects malicious
   pickles and accepts tensor-only checkpoints. These are baseline checks
   on the PyTorch contract ARC relies on.

2. ARC wrapper guards (test_meta_model_trainer_attempts_weights_only,
   test_failure_predictor_attempts_weights_only,
   test_adaptive_checkpointer_attempts_weights_only): spy on the
   ``torch.load`` calls made by each of ARC's three checkpoint-loading
   wrappers and verify the first attempt always uses ``weights_only=True``.
   If a future refactor drops or weakens the flag in any wrapper, the
   corresponding test fails.

The fallback path (``weights_only=False`` after ``pickle.UnpicklingError``
or a recognised ``RuntimeError``) is intentionally permissive for backward
compatibility with checkpoints that include optimizer state or other
non-tensor objects. See SECURITY.md for the full trust boundary.
